# CoLM Python Version (v1.0)
# Project Overview
The Common Land Model (CoLM) is widely used for simulating land surface processes, including key aspects such as terrestrial hydrology, energy balance, and carbon cycles. We have developed a Python version of CoLM (v1.0) to enhance its scalability and usability by leveraging Python's modern programming language and frameworks, paving the way for integration with Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the future.

This version ensures consistency with the Fortran-based implementation of CoLM, maintaining the accuracy and reliability of scientific computations.

Executives: Zhu Jinlong, Li Qingliang, Zhang Cheng and Zhong Zhichao
